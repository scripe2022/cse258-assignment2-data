I have also initialized a random position embeddings tensor. I add these two and pass them into the streamline, but I have been confused on where I update the word embeddings. I have a training function but I assume I have to explicitly update the word embeddings to new ones right. Right now, my training and testing accuracy are basically at 44% and 33%. I assume this is because I am not updating the weights. To what values should I update to if I should manually do so, or is it basically my logic that is causing the problem?"}],"type":"question","tags":["pa2","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Rahul Sharma Nemmani","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"jml95ci0otv4w9","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Hengzhou Li","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182ytxamho4es","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Tianyi Zheng","endorser":{"m182y0mqvor2k7":1730169909},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yt8a22e4cr","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Chia-Yuan Chang","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"lmuvcudy1qiwc","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Madurya Suresh","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yu2idsy4f6","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":140,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-28T06:36:59Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"ku2mpmjms7n645","subject":"","created":"2024-10-28T06:36:59Z","content":"<md>Word and positional embeddings are automatically updated with `loss.backward()` and `optimizer.step()` functions.\n\nI think this is a good example:\nhttps://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/pytorch_with_examples.html#pytorch-control-flow-weight-sharing\n\nMake sure your training loop has in the right order\n\n- forward (forward function in the model)\n- Compute loss\n- optimizer.zero_grad()\n- loss.backward()\n- optimizer.step()</md>"}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m2snc07tsd64ih","config":{"editor":"md"},"is_tag_endorse":false},{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-29T08:10:22Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"student","name":"William He","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yx8vymi4ns","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Vincent Thai","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yq7tlkm442","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Madurya Suresh","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yu2idsy4f6","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"m182yt8a22e4cr","subject":"","created":"2024-10-29T08:10:22Z","content":"<md>I was having a very similar problem to yours: my training and testing accuracy were stuck at 44% and 33% on the vast majority of runs, but I would strangely get 90+% and 80+% accuracies every once in a while.\n\nI tweaked the layers of the FFN in my classifier and that somehow fixed the problem on my end (in particular, by changing where I apply my non-linearity functions).
