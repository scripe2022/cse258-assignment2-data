The reason for the error is that I wanted to merge a string like <code>er \\</code> into <code>er\\</code>. The pair looks like <code>(&#39;er&#39;, &#39;\\\\&#39;)</code>. However, after running <code>re.escape(&#39; &#39;.join(pair))</code>, it turned into <code>&#39;er\\\\ \\\\\\\\&#39;</code>, which looks strange. My regular expression is <code>re.compile(&#39;(?&lt;!\\\\S)er\\\\ \\\\\\\\(?!\\\\S)&#39;)</code>. Therefore, when I tried to replace it, my <code>p.sub(&#39;&#39;.join(pair), word)</code> raised the error: &#34;bad escape (end of pattern)&#34;. I want to understand why this is happening. Thank you so much.</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["pa1","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Erica Cheng","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182ygrlgf83d9","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":133,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-17T14:47:13Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"ln0md59uz9w3kd","subject":"","created":"2024-10-17T14:47:13Z","content":"<a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33582162/confused-about-backslashes-in-regular-expressions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33582162/confused-about-backslashes-in-regular-expressions</a><br /><br />Please let us know if you have further questions."}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m2df031pgia2mn","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":["m182ygrlgf83d9"],"no_answer":0,"id":"m2d2r8zzpcp4va","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":2,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731990174256,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3ny8bhg3i12cs"}
