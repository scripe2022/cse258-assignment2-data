Go to Pytorch documentation, and there you should be able to see how to show whether your gradient is None or it has some value. If it is None, then one of the problem may be that your model does not set the &#39;&#39;requirement for grad&#39;&#39; attribute appropriately. Go to documentation and set it to the correct one before you initialize your optimizer, and you may solve the problem where your gradient is None for each iteration.</p>","created":"2024-10-18T01:40:42Z","bucket_order":6,"bucket_name":"Last week","type":"feedback","tag_good":[{"role":"ta","name":"Po-Chun Wu","endorser":{},"admin":true,"photo":null,"id":"ln0md59uz9w3kd","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"uid_a":"a_0","children":[],"tag_good_arr":["ln0md59uz9w3kd"],"id":"m2e2ch76o1s7t","updated":"2024-10-18T01:41:20Z","config":{"editor":"rte"}}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":1,"id":"m2dzu0chk6z6ir","updated":"2024-10-18T01:40:42Z","config":{"editor":"rte"}}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m2dxyzp9rv54yx","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":2,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731990192038,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3ny8p7chhk7iu"}
