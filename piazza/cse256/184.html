There might be multiple reasons why the first method works better in this particular task. For example, the training and testing corpus in this assignment is relatively small, so padding all sentences to the same length might help with stability in learning. Additionally, padding all sentences to the longest length introduces a more consistent input size, which might make it easier for the model to generalize on this smaller dataset. It could also be that certain architectures, optimizers, or other hyper-parameters benefit from the fixed input size that comes with padding to the longest sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Great to see that you tried different padding approaches.
