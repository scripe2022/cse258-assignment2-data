So for example in the sentence, &#34;the fox went to the forest&#34;, it can be possible that the characters &#39;e&#39; and &#39; &#39; get paired together. However, the way that my __getitem__, it seems that the input to  my function is an array of words without the spaces. So, for the previous statement, the input for the __getitem__ function would [&#34;the&#34;,&#34;fox&#34;,&#34;went&#34;,&#34;to&#34;,&#34;the&#34;,&#34;forest&#34;]. Because the spaces are not considered anymore, would this be a problem, and I would have to make sure I add the ascii values of the spaces after each word is processed before mapping the subwords?  ","created":"2024-10-15T18:34:43Z","bucket_order":3,"bucket_name":"Today","type":"followup","tag_good":[],"uid_a":"a_0","children":[{"anon":"no","folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":null},"subject":"Sounds reasonable.","created":"2024-10-15T18:37:29Z","bucket_order":3,"bucket_name":"Today","type":"feedback","tag_good":[],"uid":"ln0md59uz9w3kd","children":[],"tag_good_arr":[],"id":"m2ascid14fb3xq","updated":"2024-10-15T18:37:29Z","config":{}}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":1,"id":"m2as8y0efft1ta","updated":"2024-10-15T18:37:29Z","config":{"editor":"rte"}}],"tag_good_arr":["m182yx8vymi4ns","jml95ci0otv4w9"],"no_answer":0,"id":"m29yy2yx79z2by","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":2,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731990107171,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3ny6vpwu3328n"}
