However in the youtube video, there is no such restriction, so a token might contain multiple words.\n\nIn practice, which method is more commonly used? In my tests, there is not much difference between the two, but I think the latter might be better. Manually intervening in BPE merging by splitting words with spaces feels somewhat counterintuitive.\n\nI noticed that the PA1 writeup explicitly mentions that we should implement \"subword\". If I don't mark the end of words and only mark the end of sentences, using an approach similar to the youtube video, and get a good accuracy (around 80%). Is this acceptable? Or must we strictly follow the subword approach as described in the lecture's pseudocode?\n\nThank you!</md>"}],"type":"question","tags":["pa1","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Yutian Shi","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kfsi52ar6572xo","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Jinyi Wan","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yqlxqmo44u","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":173,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-12T16:04:31Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"student","name":"Yutian Shi","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kfsi52ar6572xo","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Jinyi Wan","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yqlxqmo44u","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"ln0md59uz9w3kd","subject":"","created":"2024-10-12T16:04:31Z","content":"<div>Well done!
