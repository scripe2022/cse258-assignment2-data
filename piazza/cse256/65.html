This involves converting the input text into its subword representation using the vocabulary created during initialization. The method should return the indices of these subwords, which will serve as input to your DAN model. The DAN model will then average the embeddings of these to generate a representation that can be processed further. Also, the DAN model associates with Byte Pair Encoding mainly through the way it processes input text for the analysis. </p>"}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":["lvdiwwr2smn3tq","jml95ci0otv4w9"],"children":[],"id":"m26um5w3oed51","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false},{"anon":"no","folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":null},"no_upvotes":0,"subject":"Also, can you make this post public instead of private (you can remain anonymous to your classmates), as others might have similar question and it could be helpful for them as well.
