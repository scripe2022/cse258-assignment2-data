Parse sentences from .txt files using SentimentDatasetDAN which will taken sentences and convert them into a list of indices (using some Indexer1)</p>\n<p>2. Pass SentimentDatasetDAN into a DataLoader</p>\n<p>3. Pass the DataLoader in a DAN nn.module where an embedding layer is initialized from read_word_embeddings().get_initialized_embedding_layer()</p>\n<p>4. Average the embeddings together per sentence and pass through FF network</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>My issue here is that in step 3 read_word_embeddings creates its own Indexer, say Indexer2, for words from the GloVe file and maps words directly to embeddings. However, we have passed in indices from a completely different Indexer() (Indexer1) to the nn.module. This would mean that I first need Indexer 1 to decode from index to word and Indexer 2 to re-encode from word to embedding, as provided by the nn.embedding layer. However, I don&#39;t have access to Indexer1 inside the DAN nn.module, and it seems like poor practice to pass the Indexer1 into that module.<br /><br />Do I have some step of this process wrong?</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["pa1","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Sarvani Kunapareddy","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":"a108afd0-df22-4c82-a48b-4615ee8b0e26_200.jpg","id":"m182yor466x3zz","photo_url":"https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/m182yor466x3zz/a108afd0-df22-4c82-a48b-4615ee8b0e26_200.jpg","published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Yutian Shi","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kfsi52ar6572xo","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Oren Ciolli","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"k188akrhtjv69o","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":147,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-15T01:02:16Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"ln0md59uz9w3kd","subject":"","created":"2024-10-15T01:02:16Z","content":"It depends on your implementation, but I think the four steps in your code flow seem reasonable."}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m29qnhuc84t4os","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":["m182yor466x3zz","kfsi52ar6572xo","k188akrhtjv69o"],"no_answer":0,"id":"m29kc3baqpe3a0","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":2,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731990102112,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3ny6rtfe6t21k"}
