First, I use BPE to generate a subword dictionary from the training data, which consists of merged pairs indexed as follows: {(113,234): 256, (123,156): 257...}.</p>\n<p>After that, I think I should encode train.txt and match the results to the subword dictionary I just built to find the correct indices. However, I’m confused about one point: if I encode each character in train.txt and try to match it, there will be no match, since the subword dictionary only contains merged pairs, which include multiple characters.  For example, if a space is encoded as 32, there is no pair in the subword dictionary that matches 32.</p>\n<p>So, is there something I’m misunderstanding? Could you give me some advice?</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["pa1","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":123,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-17T21:31:50Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"ln0md59uz9w3kd","subject":"","created":"2024-10-17T21:31:50Z","content":"The subword dictionary should include both the <strong>initial vocabulary</strong> (i.e., individual characters) and the <strong>merged pairs</strong> that are created during the BPE process."}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m2dtgfe4axu53v","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m2dr89wxpw27p5","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":2,"num_favorites":1,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731990181890,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3ny8hdgdh4fn"}
