In my opinion, if your net cannot overfit the data, then likely it is one of 3 problems:<br />a. Network capacity is too small - This is very unlikely as the data itself is very small</p>\n<p>b. The data input and expected outputs are misaligned/mismatched or just meaningless</p>\n<p>c. The learning paradigm is wrong i.e wrong activation, wrong loss function etc.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can check the following:</p>\n<p>1. Do you have the log_softmax activation at the end layer of the model similar to Prof&#39;s BOW model?<br />2. Check if the glove embeds you are loading and then your parsing make sense. Example, PAD and UNK should be 0 and 1, and then there are some words like &#39;the&#39;, &#39;.&#39;, &#39;,&#39; which occur at the start of the large text file.<br />Make a simple example sentence like &#34;the bruehsbayreuyhr . , the&#34; and check if it translates to something like 3, 1, 4, 5 where 1 is UNK and rest match the indices from the large text file of Glove embeds.Â </p>"}],"type":"s_answer","tag_endorse_arr":["ln0md59uz9w3kd"],"children":[],"id":"m2d5j183osl2pw","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m2d2empb390550","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":2,"num_favorites":2,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731990172992,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3ny8aibusy7o3"}
