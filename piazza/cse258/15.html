I&#39;m reaching out on behalf of the IEEE Student Branch at UC San Diego to kindly ask if you could share two exciting opportunities with your students.<br /><br />Week 1 Events: We are hosting a variety of events in the first week of the fall quarter to kick off the academic year.<br /><br />Quarterly Projects Info Session: We are also launching our IEEE Fall Quarterly Projects, where students can form teams, tackle a technical challenge, and build hands-on projects. I&#39;ve attached a flyer with the application deadline and QR codes for both mentor and participant sign-ups.<br /><br />Iâ€™ve attached both flyers with all the details. We would greatly appreciate it if you could share these with your class. Should you or your students have any questions, feel free to contact us directly.<br /><br />Thank you for helping us spread the word about these valuable opportunities!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Ficbjgije2033xe%2Fbcded3a377fb4eea4e61764b8e18ac535b2aff7293872e166cc66b7833db1843%2FReverse_Career_Fair_2025_-_Flyer.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"647\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Ficbjgije2033xe%2Fafbb8893160ab14e647ee61118d2c17f26f12cf405383a83302eaa1432e61656%2Fweek1events.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Ficbjgije2033xe%2F00942838c5774513267762ef8c37b0910f949072e60d12fffdcd84276cd5f83c%2F3_QP_Flyer.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"647\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"}],"type":"note","tags":["instructor-note","other"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":362,"children":[],"tag_good_arr":[],"id":"m1qq1wgoyl81tn","config":{"has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":2,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731989050001,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nxk803bbz6hr"}
