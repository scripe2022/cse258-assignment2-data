I'm working on Agential (https://github.com/agential-ai/agential), an LLM-based agent research project that tests prompt-based agent methods across diverse reasoning benchmarks.\n\nThis project is for you if you're looking to:\n- *Collaborate* on an open-source, research project\n- *Sharpen* your software engineering skills\n- *Deepen* your understanding of LLMs and LLM-based agents\n\n**What I'm looking for**\n- A strong passion for open-source and research engineering\n- A strong initiative taker and problem solver\n- proficient experience with Python\n\n**Nice-to-have technical skills** \n- NLP research experience\n- background in language agents\n- familiar with open-source\n\n*Note: As this project is open-source, it benefits greatly from more contributors! Besides \"What I'm looking for\", there are no strict technical requirements. Though they are nice-to-have, the biggest indicators for success is a strong passion and sense of initiative!*\n\n**What you'll do** <br>\nI'm looking for people who are interested in NLP, LLMs, and particularly language agents. You'll be responsible for reading method/benchmark papers and implementing them *thoroughly*!\n\n**Application Process**\n1. Fill out the form below\n2. I'll get in touch as soon as I can!\n3. We'll schedule a 30-minute chat\n4. Onboarding (< 1 week): background literature and familiarizing yourself with the code base\n5. Getting started on your first PR! 🥳 \n\nFor any questions or concerns, email me at tuvincent0106@gmail.com or vitu@ucsd.edu.\nIf you're interested, fill out the form below (it's just for me to gauge your interests in AI/ML) and I'll be in touch soon! 🙂 <br><br>\nhttps://forms.gle/TaosA4j6T1xWETnAA</md>"}],"type":"note","tags":["other","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Vincent Tu","endorser":{"ktt19bg7rjnu3":1635649371,"global":1637229458},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"ku2mksu8tjt6wo","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Sarvani Kunapareddy","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":"a108afd0-df22-4c82-a48b-4615ee8b0e26_200.jpg","id":"m182yor466x3zz","photo_url":"https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/m182yor466x3zz/a108afd0-df22-4c82-a48b-4615ee8b0e26_200.jpg","published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Brian Dinh","endorser":{"kfbl4a30mii5kq":1604903364,"global":1606859635,"kfrjlybsasg1pl":1606859635,"khsqnoitk6s3bb":1611077751,"khsqj6nzi1h5sl":1611692722,"ktixnxijtxq13o":1633499067},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kfshpjktxvu169","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":213,"children":[],"tag_good_arr":["ku2mksu8tjt6wo","m182yor466x3zz","kfshpjktxvu169"],"id":"m2nuiur7m7u2qn","config":{"editor":"md","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":2,"num_favorites":2,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731989157514,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nxmiylwnn106"}
