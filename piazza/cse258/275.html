I had a few follow up questions:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. Does this mean we can build a feature vector from the training data and use logistic regression for read predictions?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Since the actual test data won&#39;t have any features I&#39;m not sure if this is the right approach or if I misunderstood. I imagine we will be storing jaccard similarities or other similarities in a separate data struct that we can use to check each u,b in test case, or handle edge cases when they haven&#39;t been seen during training?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. Also in hw3 we were just using if statements to check for jaccard threshold or membership in popularity set, so I thought the whole point was to make predictions without features? or that still a valid approach? I think if we combine multiple similarity functions and other heuristics together the if/else statements might get a little long.</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["assignment1","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Nikita Kachappilly","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yixnjz43iv","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":245,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-13T07:11:15Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"ta","name":"Vijayamohan Shanmuga Vadivel","endorser":{},"admin":true,"photo":null,"id":"lkr28ksf2oy3o0","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"m1fmx1u8jv86ak","subject":"","created":"2024-11-13T07:11:15Z","content":"You can and probably should implement a feature vector from the training data and feed it into a classifier model like logistic regression; Dr. McAuley suggested this in e.g. question @144.
