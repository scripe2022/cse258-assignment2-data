I noticed that the stub code writes the answers using single quotes (<code>&#39;Q1&#39;</code>), but the autograder expects JSON format with double quotes (<code>&#34;Q1&#34;</code>). To fix this, I manually changed the single quotes to double quotes in the final file I submitted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This might mean that the answers in my submitted file have different quotes compared to the output directly from running my code. I wanted to check if this kind of formatting change could cause any misunderstandings for the TAs during grading. I didn&#39;t change any of the actual answers, just the quote formatting to match what&#39;s required.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks for any clarification!</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw1","hw2","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":179,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-23T20:49:29Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"student","name":"Zhengxi Yang","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yh0luj23dw","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"kfmyfwqtwhdcp","subject":"","created":"2024-10-23T20:49:29Z","content":"<md>It will not cause problems.</md>"}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":["m182yh0luj23dw"],"children":[],"id":"m2mcl33y45l123","config":{"editor":"md"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m2m3x4darip7em","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":3,"num_favorites":1,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731989144906,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nxm98fi9623"}
