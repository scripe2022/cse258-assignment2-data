Its a ratio between 0 and 1. So, the sum(sim) will never be less than zero. They check for &#39;&gt; 0&#39; to avoid division by zero. In the case where there are no items that are similar to your item, its up to you how you want to implement. You can return the global training mean or you can return the user&#39;s average rating.
