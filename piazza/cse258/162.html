For example, the scale of threshold value changes based on the strategy used. If I use the threshold as a multiplier for the ordered cumulative read counts as described in the baseline code, my answer is scaled between 0 and 1. If I use some other strategy like topK (scale in 100s) or percentiles (between 0 and &lt;100).
