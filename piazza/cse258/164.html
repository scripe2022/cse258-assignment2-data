I think MAE would be better for this dataset, right?</p>\n<p>I know in the class/textbook we discuss that MSE corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimator assuming normally distributed data. So would a good answer be something like &#34;If the data is normally distributed, MSE is the better option. If it has a long tail or is heavily skewed in one direction of the mean, then MAE would be better. Since hours played is lower-bounded at 0 and has no upper-bound, and the mean of the data is 66 hours while the max is over 16,000, MAE is the better choice&#34;.</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["midterm","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":234,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-04T03:16:47Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"student","name":"Marshall Fisher","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m1fmx1u8jv86ak","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"icbjgije2033xe","subject":"","created":"2024-11-04T03:16:47Z","content":"Your suggested answer seems pretty much on point for this question."}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":["m1fmx1u8jv86ak"],"children":[],"id":"m32g9j0gfps4zs","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m32fs59yr5q","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":3,"num_favorites":2,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731989238449,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nxo9erc7k3ql"}
