Specifically, the difference appears only in the very last decimal place of the MSE (e.g., <code>1.4809577272649477</code> vs. <code>1.4809577272649488</code>). </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I got all the other questions right after submitting my answer on gradescope, except for Q4. I spent a lot of time checking my code and logic, but then I suspected that this might be due to floating-point precision differences. If my guess is right, it&#39;s really confusing to keep encountering this problem in the future. Also, I&#39;m wondering if it will affect my score. Is there any way to solve it?
