The baseline predictor returns a set of the most popular books by the top 50% read count (~500 out of ~6000&#43; total books).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>1. The new validation set would be twice the size of the original one (so for each (user, book pair), I get a (user, book not read) pair for each entry) right? Meaning that for each user there are an equal amount of read and not read book pairs?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. How is the accuracy calculated in this case? Do we just compare EACH book for EACH user with EACH book in the return1 set and add 1 for (book read by user AND book in return1) and 0 for (book not read by user AND book in return1)? How would we deal with books a user has read but they are not in return1?</p>\n<p>Also, what should be the denominator when calculating accuracy?<br />Is the accuracy per user or aggregated over all users? If aggregated then what would be in the denominator diving the matching counts?</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw3","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Brian Dinh","endorser":{"kfbl4a30mii5kq":1604903364,"global":1606859635,"kfrjlybsasg1pl":1606859635,"khsqnoitk6s3bb":1611077751,"khsqj6nzi1h5sl":1611692722,"ktixnxijtxq13o":1633499067},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kfshpjktxvu169","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Presley Cheng","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"k601ytofgz23zp","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":215,"children":[{"history_size":2,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-03T22:05:54Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"lkrqqe1qcih2y","subject":"","created":"2024-11-03T22:06:05Z","content":"<p>1. yeah, each user/book pair (read) is matched by randomly sampling a book the user hasn&#39;t read<br /><br /></p>\n<p>2.
