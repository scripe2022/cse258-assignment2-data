I have a question about Question 8 in HW 2. The instructions mention modifying the similarity function from Question 7 by interchanging users and items, specifically using Sim(u,v) instead of Sim(i,j). I wanted to clarify whether we are only changing Sim(u,v) while keeping the other terms the same, or if the ij-related terms should also be changed. Could you also provide a clear formula for r(u,i) simlar to Q7 in this case? Thank you!"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw2","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":265,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-18T23:17:13Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"l891nxbe2831oz","subject":"","created":"2024-10-18T23:17:13Z","content":"<md>If a term is related to `j`, it should and has to be changed.</md>"}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m2fcnsolad5488","config":{"editor":"md"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m2e023mnaiyea","config":{"has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":3,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731989122149,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nxlrnrneb28l"}
