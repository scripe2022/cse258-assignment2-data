Since the majority of the gender labels in the dataset are male, I assumed that using the count of exclamation marks (!) as a feature might not be the best way to predict gender. As a result, I obtained very low results for:\n\nQ6: I got very imbalanced results, and the model didn’t seem to perform well in terms of distinguishing between genders.\nQ7: After applying class_weight=&#39;balanced&#39;, the results improved slightly, but the performance was still quite low.\nQ8: The precision@K values for various K values were also very low.\n\nGiven these outcomes, I’m unsure if I missed something in my approach, or if the imbalance in the dataset and the feature selection naturally leads to such low results. Could someone clarify if this is expected or if there’s something I should do differently to improve the predictions?\n\nAdditionally, I’ve run my code in Jupyter Notebook and then exported it to Python (.py), but all the functions appear sequentially without much structure. Is there a preferred format or style we need to follow for the Python code submission (e.g., organizing functions, including comments, etc.)?"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw1","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Roham Mehrabi","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"ku2683bcfab1dp","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":324,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-18T02:17:58Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"icbjgije2033xe","subject":"","created":"2024-10-18T02:17:58Z","content":"Did your code pass the autograder?
