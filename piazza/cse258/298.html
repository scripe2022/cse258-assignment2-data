I sampled negative samples for training set and sliced it not to overfit.<br />I am using popularity (binary), max and average item-item Jaccard and Cosine (continuous), some and/or combinations of their thresholded versions. I did dimensionality reduction after feature engineering and cross validation to tune the parameters for LogisticRegression and some other ML algorithms. These techniques do not improve popularity based prediction.Â <br />What can you suggest to overcome this?
