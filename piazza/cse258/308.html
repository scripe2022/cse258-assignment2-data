It is mentioned the performance will mainly be evaluated \"on the unseen portion of the test data\". However, it's also mentioned that \"the auto-grader will not execute your code\". What is the evaluation process for the unseen test data? My understanding is that the \"unseen\" data is also included in the `pairs_Read.csv` and `pairs_Rating.csv`, though only part of these two files are used when calculating the leaderboard. Evaluation on the \"unseen\" data is also based on these two `csv` files, without executing the code?\n\n2. Currently Gradescope's autograder score is shown as:\n```\nCheck submitted files (0/0)\n0) for debugging (0/0)\n1) report (2/2)\n2) rating prediction, public performance (2/2)\n5) read prediction, public performance (2/2)\n```\nAre there 3) and 4) for the autograder? In addition, is the total score for autograder \"6/22\" rather than \"22/22\"?\n\nThank you!</md>"}],"type":"question","tags":["assignment1","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Nikita Kachappilly","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yixnjz43iv","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Pranav Raj","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"lmt7ywrfry06ky","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Akshaya Thenkarai Lakshminarasimhan","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":"a279cbe3-5f08-48df-8ab5-60a1ba1c8994_200.jpg","id":"m182yjodigv3la","photo_url":"https://cdn-uploads.piazza.com/photos/m182yjodigv3la/a279cbe3-5f08-48df-8ab5-60a1ba1c8994_200.jpg","published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Chung-Pang Wang","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"lmpga2lrlrf66j","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":269,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-18T05:12:01Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"student","name":"Yiming Zhao","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m182yh5xj63ea","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"l8ahme2w72j6gs","subject":"","created":"2024-11-18T05:12:01Z","content":"<md>Yes the x_test is included in the given files.
