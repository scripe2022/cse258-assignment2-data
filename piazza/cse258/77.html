According to the lecture on Oct 15 (Tuesday), we compute precision using TP/sum(prediction). Further, when we compute precision_k, we use sum(sorted_labels[:k])/k. I agree that the later formula is consistent with the former formula when sum(prediction[:k]) = k. But I wonder whether the formula for precision_k stays the same even when sorted_labels[:k] &lt; k. I have this question as this seems to be the scenario in HW1, Q8.
