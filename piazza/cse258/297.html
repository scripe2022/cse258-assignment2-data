I&#39;m pretty sure I implemented partial derivatives correctly, but mse does not converge and even keeps increasing by a lot. Specifically, parameter value increases a lot compared to the previous iteration. I computed partial derivatives for each parameter at each iteration, and updated the parameters simultaneously at the end of the iteration. (alpha = alpha - learning_rate * derivatie(alpha)).  Is there anything that could possibly be wrong? I&#39;m currently using SSE&#43;regularizer as my objective function. Since parameters are getting too high now, is it helpful to change it to MSE&#43;regularizer?"}],"type":"question","tags":["assignment1","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":255,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-16T19:50:20Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"ku2mpnf09v965r","subject":"","created":"2024-11-16T19:50:20Z","content":"<p>I&#39;m not sure, but your code might have errors if you implement gradient descent from scratch. </p>\n<p>Usually people use machine learning libraries (e.g., tensorflow, pytorch), so that the library handles the gradient computation and updates for you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But if you are quite certain about your code, you may try printing out (or plotting) the training and validation metrics (MSE and SSE won&#39;t make lot a of difference).
