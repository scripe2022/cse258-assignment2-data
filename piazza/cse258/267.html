I want to train a classifier on allRatings but it takes 2&#43; hours to generate similarities for item-item setting (as in HW3 Q3) on allRatings data not to mention the negative sample added version. I feel like this is not feasible. Am I missing something or can I just train on ratingsValid? Plus, do you recommend using the thresholded similarities or plain as feature? When I choose a threshold among 1000 values, all predictions are 0s.
