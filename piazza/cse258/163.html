Since we are doing our &#34;testing&#34; on the validation set, is the autograder testing our response on a hidden set? I don&#39;t understand how this could be since we are not creating a model, just returning stating accuracies in the answers.txt</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>2. Unlike the other homeworks, this one seems to be a little more ambiguous in the sense that I&#39;m not as sure of my final answers as HW1 and HW2 (also given that there is some randomness built in the answers). Does that mean that if I pass the autograder that <em><strong>my answer is within reasonable margins and I will get full points</strong></em>? Or is it possible I passed it by chance due to the randomness? I passed the autograder questions I have done so far but wasn&#39;t sure of my answers/autograder passing it. in @117 Julian said that too high of an accuracy will also fail so there seems to be a band of answers that can pass?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>3.
