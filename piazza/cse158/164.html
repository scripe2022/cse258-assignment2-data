I&#39;m now confused as to how exactly to use the baseline model. I dont know what the baseline model is supposed to do, what it takes as input and what it outputs. I&#39;m not exactly sure what the function of return1 is, but I do know its just a set of books that are the top most popular books. I&#39;d appreciate any advice and resources like notebooks that point to how to approach this.
