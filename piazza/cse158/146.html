I have constructed a validation set by appending a negative sample( (u,b) pair where user has not read the book) for each entry in the validation set as described by the question. I calculated the accuracy using the baseline predictor with different thresholds(50% for q1, and a variety of values for q2). I am passing question 2 on gradescope, but not passing question 1. How is this possible? I am calculating accuracy in the same manner and using the exact same predictor function(with different thresholds) for both questions. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw3","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":268,"children":[{"history_size":2,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-29T20:53:26Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"stud","uid_a":"a_1","subject":"","created":"2024-10-29T20:55:48Z","content":"Your predictor should be if the book is in return1 I believe for Q1."},{"anon":"stud","uid_a":"a_1","subject":"","created":"2024-10-29T20:53:26Z","content":"A positive sample is a someone who read the book.
