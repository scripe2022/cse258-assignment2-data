If you use Windows I would recommend using WSL and doing it through that package manager, but it is up to you), but you want to install `pip` to manage python packages and then `pip install jupyter` to install the `jupyter` package. \n\nFrom there I would recommend you use the VSCode Jupyter extension to run your code in the notebook. I think you can avoid installing pip with google colab, but then you are stuck with their editor and whatever memory you have in your runtime will disappear after some time. Another alternative is you can spin up a server using the `jupyter notebook` command after installing the `jupyter` package, but I also find this editor to be worse than the VSCode extension.</md>"}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m1lmsrdoblt5yp","config":{"editor":"md"},"is_tag_endorse":false},{"anon":"stud","folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":null},"no_upvotes":0,"subject":"I&#39;m working with MacOS","created":"2024-09-28T04:42:01Z","bucket_order":3,"bucket_name":"Today","type":"followup","tag_good":[],"uid_a":"a_0","children":[{"anon":"stud","folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":null},"subject":"I think you can use a package manager? homebrew or something? idrk.
