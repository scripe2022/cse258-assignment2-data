I didn&#39;t know the autograde doesn&#39;t work if the answers are not native, and I&#39;ve been just submitting my homework without using the snippet posted on the gradescope so far. I was wondering if that would make me get 0 for both homework 1 and 2. My understanding was the autograder was just there in case my work needs to be graded on partial credits. Please let me know, thank you.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl8kmaqkihir7b5%2F0d5deefb4dff9435ac032871879096f1348af6d1f944035260220fb369fe56d8%2FScreenshot_2024-11-04_at_6.35.39_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_2024-11-04_at_6.35.39_PM.pngNaN\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"/redirect/s3?bucket=uploads&amp;prefix=paste%2Fl8kmaqkihir7b5%2F9ff29a062c8c79e2640da02554c4f6aef2ce0ef1c0a9a4fcede966d3f5cb331c%2FScreenshot_2024-11-04_at_6.33.39_PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot_2024-11-04_at_6.33.39_PM.pngNaN\" /></p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["logistics","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":195,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-05T03:42:35Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"icbjgije2033xe","subject":"","created":"2024-11-05T03:42:35Z","content":"You have been getting zero for all assignments since your submission files don&#39;t use numbers.
