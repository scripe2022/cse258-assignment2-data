I&#39;m reaching out on behalf of the IEEE Student Branch at UC San Diego to kindly ask if you could share two exciting opportunities with your students.<br /><br />Week 1 Events: We are hosting a variety of events in the first week of the fall quarter to kick off the academic year.<br /><br />Quarterly Projects Info Session: We are also launching our IEEE Fall Quarterly Projects, where students can form teams, tackle a technical challenge, and build hands-on projects. I&#39;ve attached a flyer with the application deadline and QR codes for both mentor and participant sign-ups.<br /><br />Iâ€™ve attached both flyers with all the details.
