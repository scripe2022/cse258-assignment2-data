I&#39;m not exactly sure how proceed with the accuracy. Im currently calculating correct answers by checking if the tuples in these predictions are in the new validation set, then dividing by the length of the new validation set, but I am getting an acc of around 75-76. I don&#39;t really have a way of knowing if I am at all in the right direction, so I would appreciate any input in my accuracy calculations.Â "}],"type":"question","tags":["hw3","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":220,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-30T22:27:44Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"ktq3zcvidvn4rg","subject":"","created":"2024-10-30T22:27:44Z","content":"<md>I think it's helpful to think of the predictor you are building as a \"f(u, i) -> y_pred\" prediction function that produces a label given any user and item pair. It returns \"user has seen item\" when the item is popular enough.\n\nTo this end its really just a classifier that operates over user-item pairs.
