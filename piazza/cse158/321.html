I tried an implementation based on what I read in the textbook (1 &#43; df(w, D) in the denominator). However, this is still causing me to fail the Q3 test case. I&#39;m wondering if my implementation is incorrect or if there&#39;s a different definition I can look for to implement this correctly. I&#39;ve submitted Gradescope for TAs to look into that if necessary.
