If so, I already understand that we are trying to implement that model but am unsure what alpha, beta_u, and beta_i are supposed to be depicted as. By the descriptions given from my screenshot above (taken from lecture slides), we can easily create a predictor by setting alpha to the average overall rating and determining beta_u and beta_i uniquely for each (user, item) pair that pops up. That being the case, where does a regularization parameter come in?

Should I keep reading more or does my issue lie with my lack of understanding of the purpose of regularizers?</p>","created":"2024-10-30T23:14:18Z","bucket_order":3,"bucket_name":"Today","type":"followup","tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Kathryn Chen","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kuq3rqgiq8q4ze","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"uid_a":"a_0","children":[],"tag_good_arr":["kuq3rqgiq8q4ze"],"no_answer":1,"id":"m2whua6p91p45i","updated":"2024-11-08T00:01:25Z","config":{"editor":"rte"}}],"tag_good_arr":["l871gw779tb1n0","kuq3rqgiq8q4ze"],"no_answer":0,"id":"m2v58kkykajb1","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":5,"num_favorites":1,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731986433666,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nw05879zw3an"}
