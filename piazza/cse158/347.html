I&#39;ve been experimenting with a couple of models and wanted to see if Surprise (from the workbook) could help me. I managed to get the model working but I&#39;m not really sure what&#39;s the best way to write its predictions to the predictions_Ratings.csv file?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, the documentation tells me I can do something like predictions = model.test to get a list of predictions for my testset, but is there a function that lets me predict a single interaction (ie. model.predict(userId, itemId) like tensorflow) so I could write each prediction to the CSV line by line? Any clarification is much appreciated, cheers!</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["assignment1","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":252,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-15T03:06:33Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"lml4g5v8hzj1lc","subject":"","created":"2024-11-15T03:06:33Z","content":"<md>You can iterate through your dataset and  predictions with the `zip` function</md>"}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m3i5qq1ai2d12p","config":{"editor":"md"},"is_tag_endorse":false},{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-15T04:00:57Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"student","name":"Gabriel Ikezaki","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"ktvoo634vpexv","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"stud","uid_a":"a_0","subject":"","created":"2024-11-15T04:00:57Z","content":"Is model.predict(user,book).est what you&#39;re looking for?"}],"type":"s_answer","tag_endorse_arr":["ktvoo634vpexv"],"children":[],"id":"m3i7oot8q2b4ma","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false},{"anon":"no","folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":null},"no_upvotes":0,"subject":"Yes that&#39;s exactly it, thank you so much!","created":"2024-11-15T04:59:33Z","bucket_order":3,"bucket_name":"Today","type":"followup","tag_good":[],"uid":"ktvoo634vpexv","children":[],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m3i9s1hpvq526o","updated":"2024-11-15T04:59:35Z","config":{"editor":"rte"}}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m3i1y1o249u23f","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":4,"num_favorites":2,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731986660362,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nw505buok68o"}
