I don&#39;t know what the best value of K is for this assignment, but it very well could be 1. The &#34;best&#34; value will be a balance between expressive power (large K) and not overfitting (small K). It costs *a lot* of parameters to have a large value of K, so in a sparse dataset (not many ratings per user / item) the best value of K could indeed be small. And that&#39;s still a &#34;valid&#34; model that is capturing interactions between users and items (albeit only along a single axis).</p>\n<p></p>"},{"anon":"no","uid":"kfo0vtto1k321a","subject":"","created":"2024-11-15T18:25:24Z","content":"<md>I may miss the context, what k are you referring to?</md>"}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":["l7uh6t6vrkdgu","l855zhvzhur6sa"],"children":[],"id":"m3j2ke0rd572mg","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false},{"anon":"no","folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":null},"no_upvotes":0,"subject":"Updated answer above.","created":"2024-11-15T19:16:58Z","bucket_order":4,"bucket_name":"Yesterday","type":"followup","tag_good":[],"uid":"icbjgije2033xe","children":[],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":1,"id":"m3j4ep2s8674pw","d-bucket":"Yesterday","updated":"2024-11-15T19:16:58Z","config":{"editor":"rte"}}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m3iidb8nen552v","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":4,"num_favorites":1,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731986664158,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nw532pn2g6si"}
