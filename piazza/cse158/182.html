Basically, if errors follow a normal distribution. A case where this is often violated is a dataset that has significant outliers -- since you&#39;re penalizing the *square* of the error, outliers can result in massive penalties and hence cause you to fit a bad model. The MAE doesn&#39;t suffer from this problem, since we wouldn&#39;t be penalizing the square of the error. But just as we showed that the MSE corresponds to a specific (Gaussian) error distribution, the MAE corresponds to a different one (I think Laplace or something, which just allows the error distribution to be long-tailed).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The midterm question only sorta hints at it, but indeed this is a dataset with big outliers, hence why the MAE would be a good choice of error metric.</p>"}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":["kby9zanm22i4n4"],"children":[],"id":"m30z2ify13y1gg","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m30ly0ny355374","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":3,"num_favorites":1,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731986453927,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nw0kutvzr5s8"}
