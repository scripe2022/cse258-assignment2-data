I noticed I am receiving a much lower MSE (~0.8) on my validation split than on the leaderboard (~1.41) , and was wondering whether this indicates that my model is not generalizable (even though it is performing well on the seen leaderboard)? If so, I would really appreciate any tips on checking the generalizability in hopes that it will perform well on the hidden test set.
