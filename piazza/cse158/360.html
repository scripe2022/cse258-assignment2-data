But I&#39;m not sure how to make the prediction. I first tried to use a dot product between the user&#39;s Latent vector and the item&#39;s Latent vector; if the score is higher than a specific value, I predict 1; otherwise, 0. Then I tried to see if the item is among the user&#39;s top N recommendations. Both of these methods not give me a high accuracy (~0.5). Is there any other way we can use BPR, or do I need to tune my hyperparameter more?</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["assignment1","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":222,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-16T19:21:36Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"ktq3zcvidvn4rg","subject":"","created":"2024-11-16T19:21:36Z","content":"What you described (using a ranking model for binary interaction classificatioN) makes sense, hard to pin-point exact reasoning of a underperforming model just from a brief description though..."}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m3kk0iit9t67ba","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m3jzmuqv1j458p","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":3,"num_favorites":1,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731986676857,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nw5cvgt3awl"}
