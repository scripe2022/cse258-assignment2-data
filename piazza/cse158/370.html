I didn&#39;t have much luck in the beginning trying to implement different feature vectors for prediction_read, but when the hw3 solution came out I decided to test the thresholds that it gave and was able to tweak it enough to pass the autograder. I was wondering, in this case how can I be sure that the solution would do well on the hidden dataset? Or if it is unlikely that it would due to me using hw3&#39;s solution with differing thresholds (doesn&#39;t seem complex enough maybe overfitting)"}],"type":"question","tags":["assignment1","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":279,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-17T00:45:05Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"student","name":"Han Hoang","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"l855zhvzhur6sa","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"icbjgije2033xe","subject":"","created":"2024-11-17T00:45:05Z","content":"Would make sure you try out any of the other hints I gave in the Tuesday lecture to improve it a bit further. Note that your leaderboard position, and absolute scores, are more important than those 2 marks for each tasks. To get 5/5 marks for the private fraction is, I think, decently hard. If you already have 2/2 for both tasks, I assume you&#39;ll safely get a decent grade, but check the pinned post with absolute thresholds as well as your leaderboard position."}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":["l855zhvzhur6sa"],"children":[],"id":"m3kvkibc7xi2ga","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m3ktv4d5c7j6e9","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":3,"num_favorites":2,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731986688296,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nw5lp6km133g"}
