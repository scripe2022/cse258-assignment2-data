How are we expected to implement this predictor? I tried scanning through the Piazza looking for a push in the right direction, but instead I feel like I&#39;ve been running in circles. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I saw a couple answers mentioning to implement the predictor using gradient descent or the iterative procedure (@177, @179, @183). I know both give similar results but am unsure how we&#39;re expected to implement them. Are we supposed to use a library that does gradient descent/iterative procedure for us or develop the gradient descent/iterative procedure code from scratch? I know there’s no example code for creating iterative procedure from scratch (@179) but there is an example of gradient descent on the course webpage. But, @264 suggests we don&#39;t need to do a manual implementation of gradient descent and should use other frameworks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The other frameworks previously mentioned are Tensorflow/Pytorch. I noticed in @257 and @258 that there are some issues involving implementing the provided Tensorflow example in workbook 5. In @257, it&#39;s mentioned that those with knowledge of tensorflow should be able to resolve the issue, but I have no experience in the such. Luckily, it&#39;s mentioned in @258 that we aren&#39;t expected to run tensorflow code for the homeworks. That is great, but now what. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From what I&#39;ve gathered, there&#39;s no direct example implementation or guide for the iterative procedure (@179), we shouldn&#39;t need to manually implement gradient descent (@264),  and we aren&#39;t expected to run Tensorflow code for the homework (@258). So 2/3 methods aren&#39;t expected but the iterative method has no guide/example. What is the expected or suggested method to implementing this predictor? Did I misinterpret any of the Piazza responses? Let me know of any thoughts and thanks in advance.</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw3","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Elaine Sun","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"l7uh7v3kyqm28d","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Jill Nomura","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"l8kmavndufo7p5","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Jennifer Yu","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"ktyqryfkel2377","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Zhenhan Hu","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"l6fxp4fv4w25pu","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":263,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-07T05:47:18Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"student","name":"Dylan Tran","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"l871grkwo481d2","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Sivaram Ari","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"l7uh7txaw4o265","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"stud","uid_a":"a_1","subject":"","created":"2024-11-07T05:47:18Z","content":"Look at the non-Tensorflow examples in the Chapter 5 workbook and understand how the code works.
