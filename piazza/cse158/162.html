I have built a validation set that consists of 20000 entries, where half the entries are negative samples(user book pairs where the user has not read the book). To get the accuracy of the baseline model, I loop through the validation set and check to see how many predictions are correct(if the book is in return1, it is predicted as &#34;read&#34; and if it is not in return1, it is predicted as &#34;not read&#34;). The accuracy is then the total number of correct predictions divided by 20000. What am I doing wrong here? I am getting an accuracy around 0.5. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw3","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Seanna Pierce","endorser":{"luggklw3wag5ca":1718054228},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kjhfcj3y6ic79f","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":236,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-30T21:37:56Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"lml4g5v8hzj1lc","subject":"","created":"2024-10-30T21:37:56Z","content":"<md>0.5 sounds low, I would look into how you're generating your negative samples.
