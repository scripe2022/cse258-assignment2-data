I thought the wait was just a weird glitch, and went on with my day. however, it&#39;s now showing as 0/25! My script is directly taken from my jupyter notebook (and the executable had run in the first two submissions), so I&#39;m not sure why it would time out on gradescope, but my answers directly are from my script, and it had compiled when I previously submitted it. The final adjustment was very minor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If possible, could staff take a look at my submission and manually correct my scoring?
