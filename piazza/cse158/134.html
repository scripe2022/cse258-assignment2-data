I had an idea for implementing this problem, which you can discover further in my most recent submission of my homework2.py file in Gradescope. What I thought it was asking is to make sure the prediction function iterates through every user and book review. This is what I implemented, but this solution is failing the autograder. Now, I realize I&#39;m probably just misunderstanding the problem. Some more explanation into what this problem is asking and how I should think about approaching it would be much appreciated.
