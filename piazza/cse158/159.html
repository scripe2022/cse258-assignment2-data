Each entry in the validation set is a user id, book id, and a score. I wrote a line of code to determine the unique scores, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Since 0 is not a positive number, are these the entries we want to consider negative when sampling? Does that indicate a user/item pair that wasn&#39;t read? In addition, I read from other Piazza posts that the baseline code structure will be used to execute this. Is that all that needs to be done to solve this problem?"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw3","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":246,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-29T20:56:04Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"ta","name":"Danial Zuberi","endorser":{},"admin":true,"photo":null,"id":"lml4g5v8hzj1lc","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"stud","uid_a":"a_1","subject":"","created":"2024-10-29T20:56:04Z","content":"A positive sample is a someone who read the book.
