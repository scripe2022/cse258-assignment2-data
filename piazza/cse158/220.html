The &#34;prediction for the median review length in the training set&#34; is literally what it says it is, a numerical value that is the median review length of the training set.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I think the best way to look at this question is by not looking at it from a machine learning perspective. Ignore that it says &#34;Hard&#34;, try not to over complicate it. Read what the guiding hint in parenthesis says. All you&#39;re doing is fitting a line through the point (0, theta_0) and (median_review_length, median_hours). Regress back to middle school or high school. When you were given two points, how did you create a line through them? Looking at the equation &#34;time played = θ0 &#43; θ1 (review length)&#34;, what if we called &#34;time played&#34; the variable &#34;y&#34; and &#34;review length&#34; the variable &#34;x&#34;. Does that equation remind you of anything? </p>"}],"type":"s_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m33ohas4joa34p","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":["l7uh3iw6mwu5k4","krtky3jb86i14i"],"no_answer":0,"id":"m33k5toalh7bk","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":3,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731986502078,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nw1m0hyk970l"}
