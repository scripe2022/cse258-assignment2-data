From the examples in class we have seen using a Linear Regression. However, I thought that we should only use a linear regression if the dependent variables are continuous and in this cause the dependent variable which is the rating is discrete. Should we still use a linear regression?"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw1","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"imholloway@ucsd.edu","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"m1fmuc1nxah1fd","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Kaiden Berchin","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"l7uh38t48ck51z","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":310,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-08T20:21:35Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"icbjgije2033xe","subject":"","created":"2024-10-08T20:21:35Z","content":"In integer is still (more or less) a continuous variable.
