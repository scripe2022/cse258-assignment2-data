I ended up figuring out that because I had used a set for iteration, the ordering was off and I had ended up using a different C than I had anticipated (for instance, calling &#34;for c in {1e-5, 1e-4, ..., 1e5}&#34; does not necessarily mean c iterates from 1e-5 to 1e5 in order).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, when I figured out the correct C value, the BER changed alongside it, and so I am a bit confused on why I got partial credit in the first place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I was just wondering as to how the values were evaluated in the Autograder and if it just checked whether the txt file values associated with a question checked for values within a certain threshold of the answer (as my incorrect value was within 0.006 of the correct value), or if the partial credit was just based on just having a response?</p>"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw2","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":131,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-10-31T21:57:17Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"icbjgije2033xe","subject":"","created":"2024-10-31T21:57:17Z","content":"It&#39;s of course possible that there&#39;s a bug in the autograder, though I haven&#39;t seen folks surface an issue about this one. Would note that the autograder doesn&#39;t actually grade the value of C, only that your logic for choosing it lines up with the previous question, i.e., the selected C value should be the one that *you reported* as having the lowest validation error. Though yeah I can imagine something like a misalignment between the ordering of answers between the questions could cause you to lose a point here. Yeah I guess I hadn&#39;t anticipated that people could reorder their C values differently than what&#39;s in the spec."}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m2xuj326znh4zj","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m2u4oqemcgb5jh","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":3,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731986421040,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nvzvhf6uj5p0"}
