If it doesn&#39;t handle those how should we respond to an unknown(never before seen) user and unknown book, unknown user but known book, known user but unknown book? For ratings I&#39;m thinking that it might be good to return the global average, book average and user average, but for read predictions is it best to just return 0/not read?
