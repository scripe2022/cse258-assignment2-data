Is it my if my code formatting is different in which I did read prediction and first and then rating prediction. Also is it fine if we modify the way we write our file different from baseline.py to the csv for predictions and read but still get a valid format. Lets say I write by doing this predictions_file.write(f&#34;{user},{item},{prediction:.4f}\\n&#34;) instead of using the write method in baseline.py. Lastly, do we need to comment which part of the code is used for Read prediction and Rating prediction?</p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n</div>"}],"type":"question","tags":["assignment1","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":294,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-11-17T19:57:01Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"l8ahma4c7ts656","subject":"","created":"2024-11-17T19:57:01Z","content":"You can restructure your code as you wish, just ensure you are reporting the correct answer as per the question, also it is best when you add comments explaining what your code is doing.Â "}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":[],"children":[],"id":"m3m0pwt28mf5zg","config":{},"is_tag_endorse":false}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"m3m0n6hezri2hy","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":3,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731986702209,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nw5wfqesj6du"}
