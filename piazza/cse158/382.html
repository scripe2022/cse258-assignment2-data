I tweaked around with the parameters and the Jaccard similarity (which is the same similarity we measured for HW3 - between different users reading b and bdash).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Is this code meant to work this way? Would it be possible to gain some insight as to whether my code is overfitting to training data?
