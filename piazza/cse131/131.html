The deadlines for the homework and the project are different. The homework is due on Thursday of week 10, before class (6/6 at 3:30 PM). The project is due on 6/15 at 11:59 PM. Due to the limited time for grading, we will not accept any late submissions. Please start early.\n\nHere are some notes regarding Project 3: \n1. Project 3 is an online assignment to be submitted on Gradescope. \n2. You are **required** to upload a zip file under Q1 and click \"Submit Assignment\" on Gradescope. \n3. For the subquestions, I would appreciate it if you could fill them out. However, submitting answers to all subquestions is not required. You may only submit a zip file as long as it contains all the required information for the assignment. \n4. I am flexible with the format of the design.pdf submission. You can either include the design.pdf inside the zip file or choose to fill in subquestion 3 without submitting the design.pdf in the zip file.</md>"}],"type":"note","tags":["instructor-note","logistics"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":28,"children":[],"tag_good_arr":[],"id":"lwpjdlanj6k487","config":{"editor":"md","is_announcement":1,"has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":1,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731991029771,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nyqnlboav6qw"}
