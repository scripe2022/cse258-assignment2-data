In the previous version of Project 1, some groups were writing much more than necessary. To make everything fair for everyone, I switched to this version and notified everyone during the discussion section and the published discussion slides. To match it with the project description, I still name it the same way as Design.pdf. I also opened the assignment three weeks ago so you should have enough time to check. \n\nIf you find it annoying and still want to submit a PDF, go ahead and do so by submitting it to the code base and sending me an email. I will manually match them up. Sorry about that.</md>","created":"2024-05-23T07:00:11Z","bucket_order":3,"bucket_name":"Today","type":"feedback","tag_good":[],"uid":"l8co2ln9yg87fy","children":[],"tag_good_arr":[],"id":"lwiwl94rzsn7ep","updated":"2024-05-23T07:01:44Z","config":{"editor":"md"}}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"lwiw9xttrkf1l","updated":"2024-05-23T07:00:13Z","config":{"editor":"md"}}],"tag_good_arr":["kfrn81jkybcyq","kddvfrmalhs1wy"],"no_answer":0,"id":"lwijv42kdjz6kv","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":4,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731991018504,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nyqewrs336nv"}
