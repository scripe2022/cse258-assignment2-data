I will  also explain this in class tomorrow. </p>\n<p>1. for &lt;1, x&gt; 1 is the key and x is the value. Similarly for &lt;x, 1&gt; x is the key and 1 is the value.</p>\n<p>2. We build 2 hashtables along the way. The first hashtable with value number as its value (e.g., &lt;x, 1&gt; &lt;y, 2&gt;, &lt;1&#43;2,3&gt;) is to record distinct values and thus <strong>identify</strong> the redundant computations. But after identifying such redundant computation, you still need to remove it. The second hashtable with variable name as its value  (e.g., &lt;3, a&gt;, &lt;1,x&gt;) is for the <strong>removal </strong>of redundant computation. In this example, after you find that c has a value number of 3 via the use of the first hashtable, you need to refer to the second hashtable to find which variable has such value, and it turns out to be a, and thus you could replace the c=x&#43;z with a.</p>\n<p>3. I hope the answers to question 1 and 2 resolve this question. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>General suggestion to all students: try to imagine you are the one to build the compiler given the motivating example. Your design are likely to be the same as the solutions provided in the lecture notes. This is how I learned the compiler course when I was a student. :)</p>"}],"type":"i_answer","tag_endorse_arr":["kfo6q7bgkkp4tj"],"children":[],"id":"luuu2hzkh67dg","config":{"editor":"rte"},"is_tag_endorse":false},{"anon":"no","folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":null},"no_upvotes":0,"subject":"wow that makes a lot more sense now, thank you!","created":"2024-04-11T06:50:37Z","bucket_order":3,"bucket_name":"Today","type":"followup","tag_good":[],"uid":"kfo6q7bgkkp4tj","children":[],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"luuvr6qzlqj44c","updated":"2024-04-11T06:50:39Z","config":{"editor":"rte"}}],"tag_good_arr":[],"no_answer":0,"id":"luus3qwd5zf75h","config":{"editor":"rte","has_emails_sent":1},"status":"active","drafts":{},"request_instructor":0,"request_instructor_me":false,"bookmarked":2,"num_favorites":0,"my_favorite":false,"is_bookmarked":false,"is_tag_good":false,"q_edits":[],"i_edits":[],"s_edits":[],"t":1731990934171,"default_anonymity":"no"},"error":null,"aid":"m3nyolu64w6hg"}
