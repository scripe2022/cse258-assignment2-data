For example we could turn times 4 into a lshi tile (with 2), which would be less tiles according to the greedy algorithm.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if we're allowed to do more complicated strength reductions, e.g. for multiplying by 5 (which has cost 4) we break it down into two tiles: lshi 2 then addi 1 (which has cost 2). Would this be done under optimal dynamic programming tiling strategy, or is tihs an entirely different thing?</md>"}],"type":"question","tags":["hw2","student"],"tag_good":[],"unique_views":27,"children":[{"history_size":3,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-05-22T14:53:08Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"l7uh0aen7ms4bp","subject":"","created":"2024-05-22T14:54:20Z","content":"<p>Although this will reduce the overall latency, I think this is not the responsibility of tiling.

Even though we know multiplying by 4 is equivalent to left shifting by 2, you may not convert all multiplications to left shifts. So, it may not be so general to do so, and it might be more appropriate to perform this optimization in the middle end.\n\nFor the hardware (HW), you may want to provide some explanation for the thing you are tiling and the intuition behind your decision to do this.
