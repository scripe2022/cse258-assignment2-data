It is nearly completely LL(1), except for one case: when we are handling statements like this:\n\n```\nid1 := id2 + 5;\n```\n\n```\nid1 := id2 (1);\n```\n\nWhile our grammar is unambiguous, it is not LL(1). We have done some left factoring already, but we run into a problem when trying to parse the right hand side of the assignment. We are currently unable to make the parser determine if the assignment is a function call or an arithmetic expression without looking ahead an additional token beyond the ID (i.e. we look to the right of the ID to determine if it is a parenthesis or not).\n\nWe know that the main way to solve these problems in our language definition is left factoring; but it seems not possible to perform this left factoring for the expression, while also preserving precedence and right associativity within the expressions. Please advise on how we should proceed.</md>"}],"type":"question","tags":["project","project∕project3","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"Eugene Yuet Chee Lau","endorser":{"l19lxxev1bg5ht":1649915158,"l7p6ab9187c4ng":1664701932,"global":1664701932,"lcoe2ubznkz4p7":1674266999},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kfo6q50fd7g4em","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Ana Maria Sampedro Barrera","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"lqwxiwk6sy4391","photo_url":null,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Matthew Peng","endorser":{"kmk4gor1tpw3mi":1618536151},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kfpn5fux2ax5y8","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"David Tran","endorser":{"lmhwg5qdgc46vu":1702599657,"global":1709773823,"lp0fztse6d42p3":1709773823},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"krqvn6kpl8b3nf","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":31,"children":[{"history_size":1,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-06-10T05:00:43Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"no","uid":"luhmx33gqzp7i5","subject":"","created":"2024-06-10T05:00:43Z","content":"<p>We can still  do a left factoring here.</p>\n<p>Assume the grammar for an operand is (variables and function names are recognized as ID)</p>\n<pre>\noperand : ID\n\t\t\t\t| ID ( expression );</pre>\n<p>After left factoring, it&#39;s</p>\n<pre>\noperand: ID tail;\ntail: \n\t\t| ( expression );</pre>\n<p>Now we can parse it by looking ahead only one token.
