However, we are stuck on understanding how the IN/OUT set of each block can help us to determine whether a defintion is reached or not. Specifically, how do these sets help us to determine that whether &#34;there is a control-flow path from d to u that does not contain an intervening definition of the same variable as d.&#34; Thanks!"}],"type":"question","tags":["project","project∕project1","student"],"tag_good":[{"role":"student","name":"David Tran","endorser":{"lmhwg5qdgc46vu":1702599657,"global":1709773823,"lp0fztse6d42p3":1709773823},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"krqvn6kpl8b3nf","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Victor Ren","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kfrn81jkybcyq","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Jong Hyun Park","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"k0y2tzqu9wmiv","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Akil Selvan Rajendra Janarthanan","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kfo6q7bgkkp4tj","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"unique_views":39,"children":[{"history_size":2,"folders":[],"data":{"embed_links":[]},"created":"2024-04-20T05:06:02Z","bucket_order":3,"tag_endorse":[{"role":"student","name":"David Tran","endorser":{"lmhwg5qdgc46vu":1702599657,"global":1709773823,"lp0fztse6d42p3":1709773823},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"krqvn6kpl8b3nf","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null},{"role":"student","name":"Akil Selvan Rajendra Janarthanan","endorser":{},"admin":false,"photo":null,"id":"kfo6q7bgkkp4tj","photo_url":null,"published":true,"us":false,"facebook_id":null}],"bucket_name":"Today","history":[{"anon":"stud","uid_a":"a_0","subject":"","created":"2024-04-20T05:06:17Z","content":"<md>According to the definition on slides, _IN[S] = set of definitions that reach the entry point of S, I think we only need to check the IN set of each basic block, and then we can know which definitions reach this block.
